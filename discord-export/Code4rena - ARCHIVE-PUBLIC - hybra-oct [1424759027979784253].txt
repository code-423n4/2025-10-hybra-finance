🔎 **Got audit-related questions? Here's your roadmap** 

Find the information you need efficiently:

1. Step 1: **Review project documentation** in the audit repo. [Join the audit](<https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-10-hybra-finance>) for access.
2. Step 2: Use **🤖 Docs Wolf,** C4's documentation bot assistant. Open a private thread, tag `@Docs Wolf`, and ask your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.
3. Step 3: If you still need clarification after reviewing the docs, feel free to **ask the Hybra Finance team** directly. From [the audit page](<https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-10-hybra-finance>), join the audit and select the `Q & A` tab.

To ensure sponsors can focus their time on questions that truly need their expertise, please: 

- Reference what you've already checked in the docs
- Be specific about what you need clarified
- Use thread replies to keep discussions organized

Good hunting!

GM wardens - automated findings should be available tomorrow (Oct 10). Appreciate your patience.

GM @🐺Wardens - the Hybra Finance audit repo now includes a list of findings identified by [V12](https://v12.zellic.io/), [Zellic](https://zellic.io)'s in-house AI auditing tool. 

[All issues found by V12](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-10-hybra-finance/blob/main/Hybra-V12-output.md) will be judged as out of scope and ineligible for awards. 

We appreciate your patience while we ironed out some details, and we expect that going forward, we'll be able to supply the V12 findings earlier in the competition.

@🐺Wardens For the Hybra Finance contest, we will be awarding any issues that are duped with V12 issues, submitted before V12 issues were publicly released, as if they are duplicates and not OOS. For example, if there is a issue that 1 warden reported before V12 findings were released, it will be awarded as if it was reported by 2 authors (the 1 warden and V12, so two in total). We understand V12 findings were released relatively late into the contest and we want to avoid Wardens feeling that they were unnecessarily punished for their efforts, so we are making an exception here
